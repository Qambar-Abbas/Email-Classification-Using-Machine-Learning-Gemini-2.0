# 📬 Inbox Cleaner & Classifier

A simple, open-source Python tool that:

1. Fetches your latest Gmail messages  
2. Classifies each as **hot lead**, **follow-up**, or **ignore/vendor** using Google Gemini 2.0  
3. Summarizes actionable tasks in a beautiful HTML “card” view  
4. Opens the summary in your browser  

Everyone is welcome to use, learn from, and contribute to this project!
